title: "Hinduism I inherited — And the One I am Rediscovering"
---

I was born into a Hindu family, inheriting a faith steeped in millennia of stories, rituals, and beliefs. Yet, as I’ve grown, I realize that the Hinduism many of us — my generation included — understand today is often filtered through lenses shaped by colonial-era scholarship, European "Indology," and Abrahamic frameworks.

As Devdutt Pattanaik insightfully observes, “The evolution of mythology and history is not a straight line from fact to fiction but a complex conversation between the two” ([source](https://devdutt.com/the-evolution-of-mythology-and-history/)). This fluidity is often lost in modern interpretations that demand a rigid division between history and myth, thereby diluting the essence of Hindu narratives.

Many of the stories we hear today are influenced by interpretations colored by Abrahamic mythology. As Devdutt points out in [*The Impact of Abrahamic Mythology*](https://devdutt.com/the-impact-of-abrahamic-mythology/), “When we read Hindu texts through the prism of Abrahamic religion, we impose categories that are foreign to the Hindu worldview.” This often leads to misunderstandings, such as the expectation of a single, fixed deity or rigid dogma, neither of which fully capture Hinduism’s inherent pluralism.

The question *“Who is a Hindu?”* remains complex and evolving. Devdutt writes in [*Who is a Hindu – No False Gods in Hinduism*](https://devdutt.com/who-is-a-hindu-no-false-gods-in-hinduism/) that Hinduism is “not about belief in a single god but about embracing multiple truths, multiple paths.” This plurality can be confusing but is essential to understanding the tradition on its own terms.

Moreover, contentious topics like the caste system often polarize opinions, fueled by both external critiques and internal politics. In [*Why Origins of the Caste System Polarise Both Left and Right*](https://devdutt.com/why-origins-of-the-caste-system-polarise-both-left-and-right/), Devdutt stresses the importance of historical context and warns against simplistic readings that serve ideological agendas.

Historians’ reluctance to engage with mythology — discussed in [*Why Are Historians Averse to Mythology?*](https://devdutt.com/why-are-historians-averse-to-mythology/) — further complicates our understanding. Mythology is often dismissed as mere fantasy, yet in Hinduism, it functions as a living framework to navigate ethics, social order, and cosmic principles.

This blog is my attempt to unravel these layers — to unlearn inherited misconceptions and rediscover Hinduism in a way that honors its depth and diversity.

Join me in this journey of rediscovery, as I share reflections, stories, and learnings from texts, traditions, and voices often sidelined.
